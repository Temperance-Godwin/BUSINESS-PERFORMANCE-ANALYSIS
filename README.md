## INTRODUCTION

In 2020, P-Roe Company, a mid-sized consumer electronics and home goods retailer, launched a major digital transformation initiative. Facing the pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company expanded its e-commerce footprint, diversified its product offerings, and extended its reach to over 30 states and 72 cities across the U.S.
By 2022, P-Roe Company had achieved strong growth-peaking in customer acquisition, revenue, and product sales. However, 2023 saw an unexpected decline in all major performance indicators. Customer engagement dropped, revenue plunged by over 60%, and several high-selling products were returning negative profits.
This decline raised serious concerns among executives: Was this a temporary dip, or a sign of strategic misalignment?
As the Business Intelligence Analyst assigned to this project, my role was to conduct a thorough analysis of the companyâ€™s performance data from 2020 to 2023. I was responsible for identifying root causes of the recent downturn and recommending strategies to reverse the negative trends and boost future performance.
This report consolidates the findings from that analysis, providing a comprehensive view of P-Roeâ€™s current position and a data-driven roadmap forward.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Address 2023 Decline:

- Investigate operational disruptions, economic factors, or shifts in customer behavior.

- Revise pricing and promotion strategies.

2. Optimize Product Portfolio:

- Focus on high-profit products like refrigerators and treadmills.

- Review or discontinue loss-making products.

3. Geographic Expansion:

- Diversify marketing efforts beyond Los Angeles and Orlando to reduce regional risk.

- Explore high-potential but underperforming cities.

4. Boost Seasonal Marketing:

- Capitalize on March and August spikes with promotions or product launches.

- Offset slow months (Jan, Sep) with bundled deals or targeted ads.

5. Customer Acquisition Strategy:

- Implement referral programs and loyalty benefits to attract new customers.

- Segment customer base and personalize engagement campaigns.

## CHALLENGES FACED ðŸ˜” 
1. Data Consistency: Minor discrepancies between reported totals and calculated values due to rounding or outliers.
2. Profitability Confusion: High-revenue products sometimes had negative profits, likely due to high costs or discounts.
3. Limited Context: No explicit marketing or operational data to explain sudden revenue/customer drops in 2023.

CONCLUSION
The company showed strong performance growth from 2020 to 2022, especially in product sales and customer engagement. However, the sharp decline in 2023 warrants further investigation and strategic realignment. By optimizing product offerings, strengthening geographic outreach, and enhancing customer acquisition tactics, the company can regain momentum and ensure sustainable growth in the years ahead.
